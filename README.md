### Testenvironment setup

We run a regtest network with 3 different nodes. This is only a local test network therefore we are not using secure password and authentication.

Bitcoin core has to be installed. 

Follow the instructions in `run.sh`. Basically we have to update the paths to the config files and data directories. Execute `run.sh` to start the test environment. Execute `stop.sh` to stop it. Communication is possible throught the bitcoin-cli.
